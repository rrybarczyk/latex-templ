\section{Deliverables}
The deliverables will be a series of bash scripts that provide the following functionality:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item $A_\mathrm{BTC}$ receives $x_\mathrm{BTC}$ from $B_\mathrm{BTC}$
\item Fires notification event indicating $A_\mathrm{BTC}$ received $x_\mathrm{BTC}$ sent by $B_\mathrm{BTC}$ and is waiting on $n_c$ confirmations on the transaction
\item Fires notification event indicating the aforementioned transaction has reached $n_c$ confirmations
\item Mints $x_\mathrm{wXLM}$ by $A_\mathrm{wXLM}$
\item Fires notification event that $x_\mathrm{wXLM}$ tokens have been minted by $A_\mathrm{wXLM}$
\item $A_\mathrm{wXLM}$ sends $x_\mathrm{wXLM}$ to $B_\mathrm{wXLM}$
\item Fires notification event that the newly minted $x_\mathrm{wXLM}$ tokens have been sent from $A_\mathrm{wXLM}$ to $B_\mathrm{wXLM}$
\item A simple set of instructions documenting how to execute the scripts
\end{enumerate}
