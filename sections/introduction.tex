\section{Overview}
Tokensoft is currently exploring the expansion of its new platform, Wrapped, to include other blockchains beyond the Ethereum network.
Tokensoft wishes to explore the Stellar blockchain as the next candidate.
The first step is to build a simple set of bash scripts that will prove out functionality so Tokensoft can determine if they want to move forward with the integration of Stellar into the Wrapped platform. \\

\noindent
The following terms are used in the Deliverables and Requirements section of this proposal.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item Account B:          Sends Bitcoin, receives Stellar token
\item wXLM:               The wrapped Stellar token
\item $A_\mathrm{BTC}$:   Account A's Bitcoin address
\item $B_\mathrm{BTC}$:   Account B's Bitcoin address
\item $A_\mathrm{wXLM}$:  Account A's Stellar address
\item $B_\mathrm{wXLM}$:  Account B's Stellar address
\item $x_\mathrm{BTC}$:   Amount of Bitcoin in sats sent to $A_\mathrm{BTC}$ from $B_\mathrm{BTC}$
\item $x_\mathrm{wXLM}$:  Amount of wrapped Stellar tokens minted by $A_\mathrm{wXLM}$ and sent to $B_\mathrm{wXLM}$
\item $n_c$:              Number of required confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain
