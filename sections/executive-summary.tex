\section{Executive Summary}
Wrapped\footnote{Wrapped. \url{https://www.wrapped.com/}} is a platform developed by Tokensoft and Anchorage allowing users to access wrapped Bitcoin via tokens on the Ethereum network.
Tokensoft intends to expand this platform beyond Ethereum, starting with Stellar.
This proposal is for a preliminary proof-of-concept design that will illustrate the wrapping of Bitcoin into a token that lives on the Stellar blockchain.
The deliverables will be a series of bash scripts that use existing blockchain explorer APIs to perform the sending and receiving of Bitcoin and the subsequent minting and sending of the wrapped Stellar tokens.
All deliverables will be submitted two weeks upon proposal acceptance. This project will take 12 hours to complete, at a rate of \$215/hr for a total of \$2,580.
